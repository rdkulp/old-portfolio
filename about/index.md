Designing and building fun and/or useful stuff for people who care is what makes me tick.

Ever since my friend taught me how to install WordPress on a shared server in 2008 I have been drawn to the web. I have used it to build blogs, sell my handmade goods with a design focus, share side projects, build out web apps, and this past Winter to pay the bills.
