I built Birth Window from the ground up (from ideation and customer research to design, development and maintenance) to make being On Call as a birth worker
more manageable.

This project taught me such a broad set of skills including
choosing a tech stack, research, git, the command line and so much more.

I started building the app with python and then Swift but found that with ruby I could accomplish a lot more in a shorter period of time and have more fun while doing it.
