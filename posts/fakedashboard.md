This is a goofy, very basic dashboard I built to see what the quickest way to
get JS data visualization up and running in order to impress a client. It didn't
impress them. But I learned roughly how to use the Victory React components, Create React
App and how to deploy to Vercel (formerly Zeit). The button doesn't go anywhere,
but it does change colors on hover.
