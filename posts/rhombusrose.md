I started Rhombus Rose to build my portfolio, showcase my design skills, and transition out of my day job of bookkeeping. I am wrapping up several projects including a membership site for a national non profit based in Boston, website for a well known Denver baker, and helping a counselor in Pasadena put the finishing touches on her [site](http://ashleymcdanielcounseling.com).
