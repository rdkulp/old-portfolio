I started Rhombus Rose at the tail end of 2019 to build my portfolio, showcase my design skills, and transition out of my day job of bookkeeping. I quickly landed several projects including a membership site for a national non profit based in Boston, website for a well known Denver baker, and helped a counselor in Pasadena put the finishing touches on her site.

Following my stint with a highly sought after design studio in Denver I launched [HWYONEPRO](https://www.hwyonepro.com) using Nuxt and am currently redesigning and building out a Shopify site for a client in the van life industry.

Building Rhombus Rose allowed me to play with different interactions. My favorite so far is the pink rhombus background overlaid with a rhombus shaped image where the corners rotate on the x axis as you scroll up and down. I accomplished this with a CSS clip-path and a scroll event that adjusts the vertices of the clip-path based on the scroll position.
