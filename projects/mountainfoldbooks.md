In January of 2015 I took the Citizen Journalism class with Kate Perdoni at
Rocky Mountain PBS/Tim Gill Center for Public Media in Colorado, Springs. The
result was a 5 minute story about Mountain Fold Books, a small press book shop,
cafe, and art gallery. It was one of my favorite places. Sadly, it no longer
exists, but here is an audio snapshot of a place in time:
